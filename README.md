The Book Publishing Pipeline is an AI-driven workflow designed to automate and streamline content creation. It begins by running the AI pipeline, which scrapes relevant content from various sources. This content is then used to generate an initial draft, which is reviewed through a human feedback loop. Based on the feedback, the draft is refined and improved iteratively. Once the final version meets quality standards, it is stored in a database for publishing or future use.
